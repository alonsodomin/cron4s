[cron4s](https://alonsodomin.github.io/cron4s) 0.3.0 has an overhaul of its internals from 0.2.1. This release is not
source compatible with previous ones as it has several API breaking changes which will make users have to update
their codebases to be able to compile with it. The list of changes in this release are:

 * Updated ScalaJS to 0.6.14
 * Support for Scala 2.12 [(#22)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/22)
 * Re-organized the built-in extensions under the `cron4s.lib` package.
 * `cron4s.expr.AnyExpr` has been renamed to `cron4s.expr.EachNode` to properly reflect the semantics of the `*` symbol in CRON expressions. [(#22)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/22)
 * Parser implementation has been rewritten using [FastParse](http://www.lihaoyi.com/fastparse/) [(#22)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/22)
 * Full type signatures in the AST are now preserved after parsing the expression [(#24)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/24)
 * The parsed expression AST is not fully validated and any error will result returning those errors instead of the actual expression object.
 * Fixed inconsistencies when stepping over enumerated values of the different expression ranges [(#28)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/28)
 * All expression and nodes now implement the `scalaz.Show` typeclass to consistently return the actual CRON string representation.
 * Common datetime operations (matching and stepping) are now supported in subexpressions (date or time only)

A [migration guide](https://alonsodomin.github.io/cron4s/docs/migration/0_3_0.html) has been published for anyone that would like to update.
