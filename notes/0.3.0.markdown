[cron4s](https://alonsodomin.github.io/cron4s) 0.3.0 has major enhancements from 0.2.1. This release is not
binary compatible with previous ones and has several API breaking changes which will make users have to update
their codebases to be able to compile with it. The list of changes in this release are:

 * Updated ScalaJS to 0.6.13
 * Support for Scala 2.12 [(#22)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/22)
 * Re-organized the built-in extensions under the `spi` package. [(#17)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/17)
 * `cron4s.expr.AnyExpr` has been renamed to `cron4s.expr.EachNode` to properly reflect the semantics of the `*` symbol in CRON expressions. [(#22)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/22)
 * Parser implementation has been rewritten using [FastParse](http://www.lihaoyi.com/fastparse/) [(#22)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/22)
 * Full type signatures in the AST are now preserved after parsing the expression [(#24)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/24)
 * The parsed expression AST is not fully validated and any error will result returning those errors instead of the actual expression object.

A [migration guide](https://alonsodomin.github.io/cron4s/docs/migration/0_3_0.html) has been published for anyone that would like to update.
