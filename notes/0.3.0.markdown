binary compatible with previous ones and has several API breaking changes which will make users have to update
their codebases to be able to compile with it. The list of changes in this release are:

 * `cron4s.expr.AnyExpr` has been renamed to `cron4s.expr.EachExpr` to properly reflect the semantics of the `*` symbol in CRON expressions. [(#22)](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/pull/22)
