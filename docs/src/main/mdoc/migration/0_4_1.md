Only those that have created their own custom datetime library integrations need to do any kind of work migration work.

### Custom DateTime Integration Changes

Prior to 0.4.1, the `set` method in the `IsDateTime` typeclass had a `Option[DateTime]` return type. Implementors should
 return a `Some(...)` if assigning the new value to the given field succeeded and a `None` otherwise. This covered two
 possible cases: 1) Unsupported fields by the `DateTime` representation and 2) Assigning an invalid value to given field.
 
In 0.4.1 the signature has changed to return a `Either[DateTimeError, DateTime]`. Implementors must now return a
 `Right(...)` when assigning the new value succeeds and in case of failures they must choose one of the following:
 
 * `cron4s.datetime.UnsupportedField`: For signalling the fact that the given field is not supported by the `DateTime`
   representation.
   
 * `cron4s.datetime.InvalidFieldValue`: For signalling the fact that the field is supported but given value can not be
   assigned to the given field.
   
Please, review the documentation at [Custom DateTimes](https://alonsodomin.github.io/cron4s/docs/custom_datetime.html).
