Idiomatic Cron expression parsing in Scala and ScalaJS.

## Setup

To start using **cron4s** in your project just include the library as part of your dependencies:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.alonsodomin.cron4s" %% "cron4s-core" % "{{site.cron4sVersion}}"
```

Or in ScalaJS:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.alonsodomin.cron4s" %%% "cron4s-core" % "{{site.cron4sVersion}}"
```

**cron4s** is cross compiled for Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13. Java 8 or later is required when using it in the JVM. 

## Limitations

Before delving into the user guide, is preferred to understand that the library at this given moment has some limitations
 in the expressions that is able to parse. These are the type of expressions that are not supported at the moment:
 
 * `L` alone in _day of month_ meaning _the last day of the month_
 * `nL` in _day of week_, being `n` a number between 0 and 6 meaning _the last day of week of a month_
 * `nW` in _day of month_, being `n` a number between 0 and 31 meaning _the nearest weekday (Monday-Friday) to the given month day_.
 * `n#m` in _day of week_, being `n` a number between 0 and 6 and `m` a number between 0 and 5 meaning _the mth day of the month_.

## Versioning

Current **cron4s** is library that is evolving towards stability and does not follow semantic versioning yet. Version
 numbers are compound of three numbers as `0.major.minor`. A change in the `minor` part means that the new version is
 source compatible (in its public API) with the previous version. A change in the `major` part means that source
 compatibility with previous version is not guaranteed. Binary compatibility is not guaranteed either in between any
 version number change.
 
Once the library reaches version `1.0.0`, semantic versioning will be adopted as follows `major.minor.patch`. Changes
 in the `major` part won't be binary or source compatible with previous version. Changes in the `minor` part will be
 source and binary compatible with previous version (with the exception of deprecated API). And changes in the `patch`
 part will mean that the library is fully source and binary compatible with previous version.
