Idiomatic Cron expression parsing in Scala and ScalaJS.

## Setup

To start using **cron4s** in your project just include the library as part of your dependencies:

```
libraryDependencies += "com.github.alonsodomin.cron4s" %% "cron4s" % "x.y.z"
```

Or in ScalaJS:

```
libraryDependencies += "com.github.alonsodomin.cron4s" %%% "cron4s" % "x.y.z"
```

## Status

At the moment the library should be considered as experimental and not ready
for production yet. APIs might change and there are some [issues](https://github.com/alonsodomin/cron4s/issues) to get sorted
out before a formal release is done.
