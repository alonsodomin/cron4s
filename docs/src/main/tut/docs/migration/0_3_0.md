## From 0.2.x to 0.3.0

There are several breaking changes in 0.3.0 when comming from the 0.2.x releases. This attempts to be a comprehensive
list of the mayor changes needed to do in user code to be able to compile it with the new version.

### Class name changes

 * All expression nodes (`Expr` suffixed classes at `cron4s.expr` package) have been renamed with a `Node` suffix instead.
 * `cron4s.expr.AnyExpr` has been renamed to `cron4s.expr.EachNode`. The new name reflects better the semantics of the `*` inside a CRON expression.
 
### Public API operations

#### DateTime operations on individual CRON expression fields

Given the following imports:

```tut:silent
import java.time._
import cron4s._
import cron4s.spi.javatime._
```

And the following inputs:

```tut
val Right(cron) = Cron("10-35 2,4,6 * * * *")
val dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2016, 12, 1, 0, 4, 9)
```

There were cases in which users could find a compilation error when using the operations `next`, `prev` and `step` in
individual field expressions when used with DateTime objects. This was due to the existence of operations with the
same names that take an `Int` as their parameter, leading to an overloaded method situation in which sometimes the
compiler refused to resolve the implicit that enable to perform such operation in the DateTime object:

```tut:fail
cron.seconds.next(dateTime)
```

To solve this problem the methods that operate on DateTime objects have been renamed including the `In` suffix:

```tut
cron.seconds.nextIn(dateTime)
```

This aligns them with the previously existent `matchesIn` method.
