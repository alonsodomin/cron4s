## From 0.3.x to 0.4.0

The path from 0.3.x version to 0.4.0 has some rough edges due to some small changes in the public API.
 
### AST Changes

Cron4s 0.4.0 comes (finally) with support for using `?` symbols in the _day of month_ and _day of week_ fields. This
 also means that the ast node that represents those fields has a type that is different from other ones. This prevents
 the programmatically creation of cron expressions using that symbol in fields where it is illegal.
 
The bad thing is that code that this breaks the binary compatibility of between 0.4.0 and previous 0.3.x and code that
 was accessing the fields themselves will need to be re-compiled.
 
### API Changes

#### Field access from expressions

The generic field access method named `field` has changed its signature. The change comes motivated by the new AST node
 and basically because in the previous version there was some awful runtime casting going on. The old and new signatures
 are as follows:
 
Old signature:

```scala
def field[F <: CronField](implicit unit: CronUnit[F]): Option[FieldNode[F]]
```

New signature:

```scala
def field[F <: CronField](implicit selector: FieldSelector[CronExpr, F]): selector.Out[F]
```

The new signature looks more complex than the previous one and sort of returns a magic type out of that implicit `selector`.
 However it comes with a big benefit:
 
The return type is now calculated at compile time and will return the right type for the given field or the code won't 
 compile. No need to work with the resulting `Option` anymore.
